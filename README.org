*** Frozen Pond
****** My current NixOS flake/dotfiles.
-----

**** Why 3 seperate dotfiles now?
I recently had to switch back to an old MacBook Pro (2013-2014) I had, and switching hardware for something like that is annoying.
I also wanted to stray away from using Home-Manager on my NixOS flake.

**** Why no HM?
While I am alright enough around home-manager, wrapping my configs and systemd-tmpfiles just feel like a better solution for me.
It's already enough for 2 module systems (flake-parts and nixos), dont need another.

**** Why switch back to a MacBook Pro?
No choice really. Not going to get to into it.
